--TODO List

1. Can make a scraper that goes through the urls of articles in db and pulls the article text from the site
2. Allow for more asset classes
3. A better sample would be 3 years, 50 articles per month (- 1800 articles) across at least 3 asset classes, validating the last 6 months.

Note on costs: 3p for embedding 7000 headlines, so estimate that 1$ cost can cover 5000 full articles
