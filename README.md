1. **Connect to MongoDB database**
  Use the password I sent you, and the email "teodor.ciurca@gmail.com" to log into MongoDB and "add current IP address". Then click "connect" to connect to database. I think you only need to do this once, but if you ever fail to connect to the database, repeat this step.
2. **Add API keys**
